# Data - Desafio de Tripulaciones


## Project Summay - Water Footprint:

Based on a meticulous tailored survey designed by the Data Team, we managed to gather over +1,000 surveys to get valuable insights of Spanish consumers water footprint. 

Our Machine Learning model was oriented towards an **unsupervised classification** problem.

After trying and investigating the most popular algorithms we decided to opt for **K-means**.

We initially decided to omit 2 out of the 15 survey questions to end up with 13 columns/features.

However, we created an algorithm to find out every possible combination with a threshold of 5 columns and ended up with 7,099 different possible combinations.

We found out the following inconvenients in other models:
* **PCA:** a lot of preprocessing had to be made.
* **DBSCAN:** the model had to be fitted for each new data inserted.



## Tasks:

* Use Git/Github commands.
* Get Data using Web Scraping and through APIÂ´s.
* Storing Data in non-relational and relational databases.
* Use SQL to retrieve info from database.
* EDA, feature engineering and apply ML models.
* Create API to manage data or ML predictions.
