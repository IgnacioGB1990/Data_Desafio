# Data - Desafio de Tripulaciones


## Project Summay - Water Footprint:

Based on a meticulous tailored survey designed by the Data Team, we managed to gather over +1,000 surveys to get valuable insights of Spanish consumers water footprint. 

Our Machine Learning model was oriented towards an **unsupervised classification** problem. After trying and investigating the most popular algorithms : K-means, PCA, DBSCAN we opted to apply *K-means*.

## Tasks:

* Use Git/Github commands.
* Get Data using Web Scraping and through APIÂ´s.
* Storing Data in non-relational and relational databases.
* Use SQL to retrieve info from database.
* EDA, feature engineering and apply ML models.
* Create API to manage data or ML predictions.
